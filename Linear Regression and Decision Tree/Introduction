We will be using Scikit learn (sklearn). It is a Python toolbox
for our tutorial.

 Step 1 : Visulization of the dataset

 y = x/2 + sin(x) + N(0,1)

 Step 2: Split the data
 Training (70%)
 Validation (15%)
 Test (15%)

 Step 3: Fit a linear Model

 Model.fit => Calculates the man squared error for every single training
 set and optimizes it. The error will be minimized by the
 gradient decend method.


 Step 4: Evaluation of the model. It will be done through Mean
 Squared Error
